### Clustering Analysis: 

Clustering analysis is often performed to explore the underlying patterns and similarities within the dataset. Clustering algorithms group compounds based on their structural and/or activity similarities. By identifying clusters of similar compounds, researchers can gain insights into structural features that contribute to similar bioactivities. Various clustering algorithms, such as k-means, hierarchical clustering, or density-based clustering, can be applied depending on the characteristics of the dataset and research goals.

Here, I have explored 3 different aglorithms :

1. Taylor's butina
2. K-means
3. Self organizing maps (SOM)
