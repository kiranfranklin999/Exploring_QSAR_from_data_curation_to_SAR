### Data Collection: 

There are several resources for the data ranging from public DBs like Chembl, bindingDB, pubchem, Drugbank etc to patents.

The first step in QSAR analysis involves gathering relevant data from sources like Chembl. Chembl provides a vast collection of bioactivity data, including molecular structures and corresponding activity values for a wide range of compounds. Researchers can retrieve data for a specific target or assay, filter it based on various criteria, and obtain a dataset that meets their research requirements.

Here, we have tried exploring the programmatic extraction of data from *Chembl* using `chembl_webresource_client`


### Data Preprocessing: 

Once the data is collected, it needs to be preprocessed to ensure its quality and compatibility for analysis. Preprocessing steps may involve handling missing values, removing duplicates, normalizing activity values, and encoding molecular structures using appropriate representations like molecular fingerprints or descriptors. Preprocessing is crucial to ensure reliable and consistent analysis results.
