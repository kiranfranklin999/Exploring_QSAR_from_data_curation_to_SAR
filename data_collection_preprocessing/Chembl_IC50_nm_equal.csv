"Binidng Assay: First, amyloid beta peptides (1-40, Peptide Institute, Minoh-shi, Osaka) were dissolved in a 50 mM phosphate buffer containing 100 mM sodium chloride (pH 7.5) such that the concentration of the amyloid beta peptides was 100 mM, and then the solution was left to stand for 16 hours at 30 C., thereby producing amyloid beta peptide aggregates. To these amyloid beta peptide, amyloid beta peptide aggregates that had been prepared in advance by the same method and sonicated for 30 minutes under 28-45-100 KHz variation were added by a 1/1000 quantity, whereby uniform amyloid beta peptide aggregates were prepared.The amyloid beta peptide aggregates prepared by the above method, thioflavin-T, and a measurement compound were added in a 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) such that the final concentrations thereof were 1 uM, 3 uM, and 0.02 to 20 uM, respectively.
